# ðŸ“Œ Graph-Based Task Scheduler
This project simulates a distributed task scheduling system using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Each node is a task with dependencies, and topological sort is used to determine execution order.

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Build and visualize DAGs using NetworkX
- Perform topological sorting for scheduling
- Plot the dependency graph using Matplotlib

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-task-scheduler.git
cd graph-task-scheduler
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
